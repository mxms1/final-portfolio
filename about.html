<div id ="life" class="container onTheSide none">
  <h2>Life</h2>
  <p>
  Adventure runs in my family - my dad is a helicopter pilot who has found himself on more than one occasion, in a situation that would make even the most hardcore daredevil shudder. Same thing with my grandfather. As a result, it seems I also inherited this family trait. When I’m not working, I love to spend my time wakeboarding or skiing, doing some kind of outdoor activity. I love to challenge myself and to try new things. For the past year I’ve been working on getting my helicopter license. I’ve already passed my driving and boating license. I’ve also been lucky enough to travel a lot with my family: Florida, Iceland, the Bahamas, Cyprus, etc… just to name a few. More recently, I’ve been using my car to go on long road trips.

  Other than adventure, my interests are far and wide. I love to keep up with the news and read about politics and learn the mechanisms behind the business world. I of course have a deep interest in physics (hence my choice to study engineering). I love to learn and broaden my mind as much as I can. I always have a need to be productive, I find it very hard to just sit back and “relax”.
